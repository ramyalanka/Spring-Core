There are 4 stereotype annotations available in 'org.springframework.stereotype' package - 

@Component – Indicates a auto scan component.
@Repository – Indicates DAO component in the persistence layer.
@Service – Indicates a Service component in the business layer.
@Controller – Indicates a controller component in the presentation layer.

In order to enable auto-scanning feature you need to add one more tag in your spring configuration file - 
<context:component-scan basePackage="your package"/>
