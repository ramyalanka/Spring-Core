@Autowired

@Autowired can be defined on the fields, methods and constructors. Note that the required attribute can be used anywhere.

But when @Autowired is used with constructors, only one constructor can be annotated with @Autowired(required=true) remaining all constructors should have @Autowired(required=false)

This annotation do the autowiring byName if possible othewise it does wiring byType.

By default required is set to true. So if any matching bean is not found, an exception will be thrown.
But if required is set to false then - 
case 1 : No mathing bean is found, Underlying property will be set to null (i.e. won't be injected).
case 2 : There are more than one matching beans are found, exception will be thrown.
case 3 : exactly one matching bean is found, property will be wired successfully.
